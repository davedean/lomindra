## Sync Tags and Labels

They're not syncing at the moment? This is an obvious oversight

## Sync Priorities

These are not syncing?! I'm surprised!!

## Sync Flags

This isn't synced??

## Sync URLs / attachments

These arent syncing?!

## Assess Non-syncing Data

What are we not syncing currently that we should be?

- tags?
- notes?
- assignees?
- locations?
- etc
- smart lists?

Are there things which are syncable with a tiny amount of "translation" between the two different representations,m but we've missed it so far?


## Notes getting lost!! 

It seems like the sync is not working great bi-direcitonal??

Some reminders seemed to sync to vikunja, losing metadata, and then rync back, losing more.

So the net effect was: my reminders lost valuable details.
